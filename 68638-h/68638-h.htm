<p>In this edition a most peculiar and pleasant effect
is wrought by casting the Song into dramatic form.
The Study is sincere, but not serious, and has
been declared by several Learned Persons, to

be a Work of Art. The Volume is thought a
seemly and precious gift from any Wife to any
Husband, or from one Friend to another.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_COMBINED_PRESS">THE COMBINED PRESS.</h2>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">It is all settled. There was no other way. Art
was held down by the Jews, who demanded that
she come to their terms. So she has given up, not, perhaps,
without a bit of a gurgle in her choked throat,
but like the new woman she has become, she manfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
faced the music with no bit of compromise.
She gave all, asking nothing but that she be placed
on a basis of “commercial independence.” I quote
from the announcement which the factory officials
make to her old time friends—those who believed
that Art should exist because she <i>was</i> Art, and that
she should not be compelled to sell her very soul for
the dollars she could earn by working overtime in
their sweat shops:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Combined Press is a literary syndicate formed
for the purpose of obtaining for writers commercial
independence and liberal remuneration for high class
work.”</p>

</div>

<p>This starts out well, and hereafter all writers who
belong shall be given a rating in <i>Bradstreet’s</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All contributors, whether stockholders or otherwise,
will be given the privilege of receiving in payment
the entire cash returns derived from their published
matter, less actual cost of service.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is encouraging, for writers may feel secure in
getting some return for their labor; but hopes are
dashed in the next paragraph:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Under no circumstances, however, will inferior
contributions be accepted from any one, and merit
will in every case be given preference regardless
either of authorship or membership.”</p>

</div>

<p>The superintendent of the factory will, of course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
be the judge as to merit. Regarding the Plan the
Sad Tale continues as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One thousand shares of stock will be issued to
writers of established merit at $15.00 per share, paid
up value. A payment of one-third of this amount
will secure each share of the stock, but no certificates
will be issued until stock becomes fully paid up,
either by assessment or by accumulation of undivided
profits.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is where the trail of the serpent shows. Mark
you: it costs sums of money to be an Artist. The
days when Genius burned the tallow dip at midnight
in the garret are forever gone, for now, when everybody
will have a commercial standing, the Artists’
Labor Union will permit of no more than eight hours
labor each day. Here follows a choice bit:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No stock will be issued to other than writers of
marked literary ability, and applicants for membership
will be required to give as reference the names
of one or more high-class publications to which they
have contributed. Applications for stock will be referred
to a committee on membership, and no stock
will be transferable, except to such as are deemed
entitled to membership by this committee.”</p>

</div>

<p><i>What</i> is “marked literary ability,” and who does
the marking?</p>

<p>The factory, as it is now conducted, will consist of
six departments. Following is a list of the Foremen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
and Forewomen to whom all complaints and applications
for positions must be made:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Fiction, Ruth McEnery Stuart; Humor, R. K.
Munkittrick; Washington, A. H. Lewis (Dan Quin);
Juvenile, John Kendrick Bangs; Woman, Frances
Bacon Paine; Agricultural, James Knapp Reeve.”</p>

</div>

<p>The following paragraph did not seem to me to be
quite complete, so I have filled out the things which
were apparently forgotten in the hurry of getting
this remarkable circular before the public:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Striking articles of adventure (true or false), discovery,
achievement and special news are desired;
also dramatic short stories, with or without action
and not less than five per cent human interest, for
young and old, especially the old; anecdotes, quaint,
humorous and pathetic; novelettes, poems, jingles,
verselets, squibs, squabs, jokes—everything, in fact,
that will interest, comfort, amuse, harass or annoy
the modern or ancient reader, thoroughly artistic in
execution, will be available.</p>

<p>“Too much emphasis cannot be placed on the statement
that only high-class matter, especially prepared
for the Combined Press, will be used at $150 a column,
net. We solicit and will pay the highest cash
prices for hides, tallow, horns and pelts. Also for
sale, cement, wool (wild from the West), hair (Le
Gallienne and Ibsen brands), bricks (with or without
straw) and material for building a modern periodical.</p>

<p>“The stock books will be closed on November fifteenth,
in order to complete the organization and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
make contracts for the coming year, stock remaining
unsold November fifteenth having been already arranged
for by parties in New York City.</p>

<p>“Address all communications to The Combined
Press, 1128-1129 American Tract Building, New
York.</p>

<p>“Directors—John Kendrick Bangs, President;
Ruth McEnery Stuart, Vice President; R. K. Munkittrick,

<p>And do my <span class="smcap">Philistine</span> readers think this is all

retain our old fashioned belief that men write because
they have something to say: because like Charles
Reade they have a purpose to accomplish; because
like Thackeray they can dazzle us with the satire of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
a master, or because like Stevenson they can take us
to Treasure Island or on that Inland Voyage where
were days of such delight as come rarely to men.</p>

<p>This circular, however, is a stubborn reality printed
in muddy black and gory red, and the word Combined
is evidently pronounced Combin-ed. It will be sent
to poor devils who imagine that by subscribing to a
fifteen-dollar share of stock, their wares may be marketed
like peaches in September, by men whose
names are known because they are signed to “verselets,
squibs and jokes” in Harper’s Drawer. Thus
may the salaries of the officers be paid. It’s a lovely
plan, and could originate in no better place than
Franklin, Ohio. Then, too, “American Tract Building”
sounds good. Surely nothing else than sincerity
could issue from a Tract Building, and a guarantee
of “commercial independence” is worth something.</p>

<p>But it’s none the less pathetic, for all that. Many
shares of stock will be taken, and many weary days
will be spent waiting for the promised halo which,
after all, wouldn’t fit if it came. It was the father of
Jules St. Ange, if I remember correctly, who made
“the so best sugah in New Orleans,” And he died
and never sold a barrel of it. He was happy because
he knew it was the best, though the commercial
men told him it was not. So, too, as all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
World’s Louis has said, “He who has meant good
work has done good work, though he has not the
time to sign his name.”</p>

<p>I knew a man once, though, who worked many
weary hours one Christmas time, and made a holiday
story for a morning paper. It was a story of such
truth as moved men to give to a hospital in a great
city such money as supported it for half a year, and
sick children were made well because of it. But he
was not a man of “marked literary ability” and he
never knew what he had done. He was not an
Adam Smith, and he knew little and cared less about
the wealth of nations. He simply wrote the truth
from a heart that knew its own. Such men do not
need to be told if their work be good or bad. They
give us the best there is in them, and we are comforted
because they have told us the things we knew
before, only we didn’t know how to put them on
paper.</p>

<p class="dropcap">He was a man of humble dress and humble
mien, and when he entered the parlor of the
rich manufacturer he was obviously dazed by the upholstery
and the pictures—especially the upholstery.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
He had to wait ten minutes before the lord of the
mansion appeared—a pompous man with an expanse
of shirt, waistcoat and watchchain that were imposing,
and a couple of whiskers that bristled in uncompromising
pride. He looked at the meek figure
seated on the edge of the least expensive chair, with
a slight expression of scorn and irritation, and
grunted, “Well, sir?”</p>

<p>“You must excuse me for coming,” said the diffident
one, “but I wish to speak to you on a matter
that is of the most vital importance to yourself.”</p>

<p>“What! Are the hands going to strike again?
D—n them!”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, please do not use such language. I
have recently been discouraged from using it myself,
and it does hurt my feelings so! I beg that you will
not employ those terms, at least, in my presence.”</p>

<p>“What in the devil”——</p>

<p>“There you are again, sir, if you please. Don’t,
I beg of you.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on.”</p>

<p>The visitor sank his voice to a thrilling undertone:
“I am told that you have wine on your table.”</p>

<p>“Of course I have. What of it?”</p>

<p>“Beware of it, sir. There is death in the glass.”</p>

<p>“Those infernal, beg your pardon, mill hands, I’ll
bet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir, not that. It is the wine itself. Keep
to water. It isn’t very good just now, but you can
filter it, or use it for tea.”</p>

<p>“Bah!”</p>

<p>“Oh, do not bah at it, sir. I’m pleading for your
good. Again, I am informed that you smoke. Stop
it, please, at once.”</p>

<p>“What! Even my cigars poisoned? This is horrible.”</p>

<p>“Tobacco is itself a poison, sir. Again, you were
not at church last Sunday. Nor at prayer meeting
on Friday night. I am told that you made no contribution
last month for foreign missions. I am credibly
informed that you have had no Bible readings in
your house for years. There is a rumor that you belong
to a club, and that you once played poker
there.”</p>

<p>The millionaire, who had been growing crimson,
now turned purple; his waistcoat inflated, his whiskers
were like quills on the porcupine. He glared
and sputtered, but could find no words.</p>

<p>“Then, too,” resumed the visitor in a meek tone,
“I hear that you patronize theaters, and have even
been to the opera; that you permit your family to
spend large sums on trivial entertainments and personal
adornment; that the amount you wasted on
dinners last winter would have repaired the alms-house;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
that you never visit the hospitals and jails;
that if you keep on in this selfish and wasteful course
you are likely to become a nuisance to the neighborhood
and a burden on the public; that”——</p>

<p>The rich man found his voice in a roar: “You audacious
scoundrel! Get out of this, or I’ll kill you.
How dare you come here and lecture me in my own
house?” And overcome by wrath he fell into an
arm chair and hissed.</p>

<p>“It’s strange that it doesn’t work both ways,” continued
the meek one, reflectively, “Your wife and
daughter called on me yesterday in the interests of
the East Side Charitable Interference Society, of
which you are president. They made me see the
error of my course, and I was actuated only by a hope
of accomplishing your moral improvement by coming
here. For is not wine worse than beer? Are not
perfectos more injurious to the health than pipes? Is
not poker more expensive than pinocle? Is not your
club more luxurious than the Peter H. Milligan Association,
of which I used to be floor manager? Isn’t
it as bad for you to go to theaters and stay away
from prayers as it is for me? Oh, brother, let me
plead with you to have more faith—to exercise more
the gifts of the spirit. Let me”——</p>

<p>At this point the millionaire struggled out of an
impending fit of apoplexy and threw a chair at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
meek man, who escaped. And the East Side Charitable
Interference Society never called on him again.
It gave him up as a hopeless case.</p>

    <div class="verse right">—Thomas William Parsons, in the <i>Century</i>.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-b.jpg" width="50" height="60" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">By title the above lines commend themselves
as “well enough” wisdom, yet will I “much
complain” of them.</p>

<p>Here are fourteen lines.</p>

<p>At glance the eye anticipates a sonnet, following
one of the fixed orders of sonnet rhymes. The end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
of the third line yielding no recurrent sound, the ear
is disappointed and infers blank verse, while expectation
is frustrated by the fourth line rhyming with
the second.</p>

<p>Did we read aright? Perhaps the first and third
lines do conform to the Shakspearean order now
suggested! Go back. “Age,”—“doing,” no! and
we reach “page” at the end of line fifth with the
suspicion that we have stumbled on a nondescript.</p>

<p>Well, give it another chance, and begin again!</p>

<p>This time we ask: what is it in the third and fourth
lines that gives the ear a sensation as if something
was struck with a hammer?</p>

<p>Yes, “round” and its iterate “rounded.”</p>

<p>Such sforzando does not occur in a good sonnet
unless there is an idea to be emphasized, to which
the mind is pointed by the ear.</p>

<p>But we conclude that this is not a sonnet, and
apatheticly scan didactic platitudes through eleven
lines till sobriety is startled by the all too frank confession
of the twelfth.</p>

<p>We read it twice, to see if it is not a lapse of grammar,
or a squeeze of “have drank” to meet the exigencies
of rhythm, and come up from the dive of the
last line thirsty to know just what image Mr. Parsons
had in his mind.</p>

<p>Was his conception analogous to that of the reporter’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
who described the pretty actress as “standing
on the brink of the rushing torrent of Niagara
and drinking it all in with shining eyes”?</p>

<p>Was “life’s full cup” so immense that Mr. Parsons
dove therein for pearls? A pretty large cup to
drink to the lees, that? Is there, as a rule, any reasonable
expectation of discovering pearls or pebbles,
or, for that matter, lees, in a wine cup? Was the
condition so awkwardly characterized in the twelfth
line—but no! there is simply an unconsidered mixing
of metaphors in this short poem, that starts with
the book of life, and in the last three lines introduces
the cup of life, and the sea of life. The last line, by
the way, is mixed upon itself. Pearls and pebbles
are not found mingled, and at the bottom of the sea,
notwithstanding Robert Browning’s Divers in <i>Pan
and Luna</i>.</p>

<p>Who dive for pearls do not so on pebbly bottoms.
No doubt, by unluck, they often bring up valueless
shells.</p>

<p>The orders of rhythms and rhymes in a sonnet are
supposed to be known to all poetasters—or one can
consult the Century Dictionary.</p>

<p>These forms should be kept in sacred reserve.
Therein the poet may mold some holy sentiment or
feeling—not with wandering thought: rising through
the personal to the universal, or perhaps veiling the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
universal in the personal. If one reproduces such
trite didactic thought, why not bestow enough labor
to shape a pure form?</p>

<p>By so doing the platitudes even might be polished
and made to shine like new, with new metaphor.</p>

<p>I have not been able to resist the temptation of
trying a prentice hand on the metaphors in Mr. Parsons’s
lines. Perhaps with more spleen against the
“well enough,” more enthusiasm for the intoxication
not of the wine, and more sympathy for the
luckless diver.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Is that ancient and honorable institution, the
New York Chamber of Commerce, becoming
frisky and convivial in its old age? Will it in its ripe
judgment recommend that the proper course for one
to pursue is to tread the perfumed paths of Bacchus?
Does the Chamber, as a body, indorse the able and
thoughtful article in the October <i>Forum</i>, by Mr.
Louis Windmuller, one of its honored members, in
which that gentleman makes a strong plea for inebriety
and drunkenness? Mr. Windmuller is certain
that the policy of Mr. Roosevelt toward the liquor interests
in New York will sap the lifeblood of our institutions,
and he sends up a cry of alarm. It may
be gathered from Mr. Windmuller’s well considered
paper that there can be no true happiness in this life
without strong drink, and plenty of it. Contentment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
and peace of mind will slink under the bed unless
there be a flagon on the table. Domestic felicity
will be a hollow mockery, a failure and a fraud if
there be not a keg in the cellar and a case of Culmbacher
on the ice.</p>

<p>Our gifted author does not say it in so many words,
but it is clearly his view that man’s faculties are at
their best only when the gentle glow of intoxication
steals over the brain and articulation thickens and
halts by the way. He goes even further. He firmly
believes that ours is a land to hastening ills a prey,
unless we speedily go to Bavaria for our excise laws
and fling Roosevelt over the Battery wall.</p>

<p>Only a lack of space prevented Mr. Windmuller
from giving the Sunday schools a side wipe, and he
comes very near it as it is. Evidently he looks upon
them as a blot or something equally unpleasant. They
have no bars, and, moreover, their teaching is all the
other way. This makes our author a prey to melancholy
and his brow is sicklied o’er with the pale cast
of thought.</p>

<p>But what the Philistines are anxious to know is,
does the ancient and honorable New York Chamber
of Commerce believe that man reaches his best estate

</div>

<p style="clear: both;"><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I suppose no one was much surprised that John
Oliver Hobbes wanted a legal release from the man
who called himself her husband, but when the
mother of Fauntleroy and the author of the <i>Quick
or the Dead</i> followed in the category of misfits I
doubt not Mona Caird lifted up her voice in the
wilderness and there was joy in the camp of the
Claflin-Woodhulls. But the marrying and giving in
marriage go right along, for this isn’t heaven; and
the multitude that don’t complain put the literary
folks who do to a kind of proof not easy to face.
Since nature made men and women to marry, the
wire-drawn literary folks who can’t stay married
have the floor for an explanation. There are bitter
critics who cry “I told you so,” and maybe they
did—when it is announced that Amelie Rives can no
longer endure her Chanler. Perhaps he is only common
tallow after all—half a dozen to the pound.
The maids and manlings who read <i>According to
St. John</i> and believed Miss Rives’s emphasized
statement that “Love is the fulfilling of the law”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
must wonder if she meant the law she has just invoked
to give her liberty. It is a choice of the
quick or the dead now—the dead love or the quick
release—and there is something more than tragic in
the appeal through a prosaic court to “deliver me
from the body of this death.” No, there is no discredit
to any one in the pleadings of the impulsive
young Southerner for her liberty. Nobody has
broken any law. They can’t live together—that’s
all, and all the amatory fury of the novel that gave
her fame is a dead waste. It was honest when it
was written, no doubt, but the pitch was too high.
The happy (more or less) millions who don’t run to
the public with a transcript of their strongest emotions
or to a court for release from their vows must
have learned a secret unknown to the Hobbeses and
the Riveses and the Bashkirtseffs. They have found
the happy middle line between the neurotic extreme
that holds the master emotion to be a matter
of physiology or of pathology—the Zolas and the
Helgardeners respectively.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I read with unfeigned regret that the repairs which
lately have been going forward in the New York
postoffice will have to be abandoned until more
funds accumulate in the United States Treasury.
This is bad. It will leave the new elevator suspended
between Heaven and earth in an unfinished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
condition for the Lord only knows how long.
Patrons of the Federal building on Manhattan Island
will therefore be obliged to patronize the two antedeluvian
other on the Park Row side. And this is always
attended with the keenest disappointments. For
example: You go to the Broadway “lift” and find
it placarded, “Not running; try the other.” You
journey around to Park Row, only to be confronted
with this, “Out of order; try Broadway.” Then
you mount the stairs, which you ought to have done
in the first place, for the reason that the man who
takes passage in one of the New York postoffice
elevators can have no possible idea when he will see
his family again. It is said that the regular patrons
of these elevators take their luncheons with them;
but this imputes to them a sprightliness of motion
which they do not possess. The gentleman who
made the ascent to the moon by way of the horns of
the Darby ram went up in January and didn’t come
down till June. Persons have been known to enter
these national “lifts” on the up trip in December
and not get back till the Fourth of July. The several
elevators in the East Aurora postoffice are of
the rapid transit variety, and never stop, except
when clogged with the <span class="smcap">Philistine’s</span> mail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> A woman who knows my weakness for potato salad
on Sunday evenings asked me to lunch with her a
few days ago. She has some boys—I don’t remember
how many, and it doesn’t really matter—who
make curious and totally irrelevant remarks, one to
the other. Then they let drive biscuits through the
air and accompany the sailing food with whoops,
great and terrible. They are good boys—as children
go—but wanting to know more about such matters,
I bought Mr. Pater’s <i>Child in the House</i> to present it
to my cousin Anthony, who has a very new boy—his
first—just to let him see what he has ahead of him.
And then it wasn’t about that kind of a boy at all.
I wonder why nobody except Mr. Aldrich has written
a story of a really truly boy.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> It is comforting to know that when a man loses
his job being president he can do such things as this
for the man who made Philadelphia and the <i>Home
Journal</i> and all that in them is:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In a series of popular articles ex-President Benjamin
Harrison will aim to explain clearly just what
this Government means and how it is conducted. He
will explain the Constitution, its origin and meaning;
outline the different legislative bodies; our foreign
relations; the power of the President; how the
House and Senate legislate, and touch upon and explain
the great National questions.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Harrison will also devote several numbers to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
a detailed description of the scrap between Colonel
William Patterson and the Unknown, endeavoring to
explain that Colonel Patterson inflicted his own
wounds in order to gain notoriety—just like Dr.
Parkhurst.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> From a magazine with four million subscribers I
clip this choice bit from The Woman’s Corner. The
advice is given by Mrs. Rorer:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Cleaning a chicken is beautiful work. It is a
deal easier than boiling potatoes and not half so
messy as painting and modeling.</p>

<p>“For brain-workers the red meats are most sustaining.
Bread and potatoes should be avoided as
much as possible. Brain-workers should avoid
warmed-over meats—the dainty entrees of which people
are so fond are simply hash, and no matter how
good the food tastes it is not wholesome.”</p>

</div>

<p>Ho! ye poets, no wonder your verse is rank; you
probably live on “simply hash;” and “warmed-over”
meats only give you warmed-over ideas. Long
have I told you to eschew sack and low company.
Now do as Mrs. Rorer says and avoid bread and potatoes,
and get comfort out of the thought that Mrs.
Rorer does not forbid you looking upon the meat
when it is red!</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The price is five cents, but is too much. The only
thing about the periodical that is pretty is the picture
on the cover, which represents a nice young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
lady in the act of crowning a black tom-cat with a
wreath of burdock. Then why a black cat? Why
not a maltese, or a tortoise shell or a plain grey
blanket? But Tom is an inky black, and looks as if
he could not keep proper hours even if he tried.
However, that marvellous cover is a bit of symbolism.
I am told that the young lady represents one of the
Mewses and the cheeky cat is Max Pemberton, who
is perfectly willing to be crowned.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I wish to notify the public that I have known
Frank A. Munsey for twenty-nine years, come Michaelmas,
and will vouch that any picture he prints is
pretty.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Possibly it is as well to confess that the Universalists
got listed with the Evangelical denominations in
the summary of the last census on a fluke. May they
do St. Peter with equal ease! Mr. Wright didn’t
know any better, but having put them there and
electrotyped the plates, he could not change the record
without considerable expense. He therefore
turned to and proved that after all Universalists were
Evangelistic and had been since the days of Constantine,
and now he offers to caper in an argument
on the question against all comers for a thousand
dollars. Darwin says we feel a thing is true first and
prove it afterward; but Mr. Wright prints it first,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
accidentally discovers it, then knowing he has to
prove it, claims it as truth and dares any one to
tread on the tail of his coat.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I notice that a famous globe-trotter is scheduled
for a series of articles for a “literary” syndicate of
some pretensions. Among her announced themes is
Etiquette, both general and particular, and lest there
be some misapprehensions I hasten to say that this
is not Mr. Bok’s social kindergarten and has no connection
with the <i>Missus’ Home Journal</i>, A department
of this subject is thus set forth in the circular:</p>

<div class="boxdots">

<p class="center">EXTRAORDINARY ETIQUETTE.</p>

<p class="center allsmcap">HOW TO MEET SOCIAL EMERGENCIES THAT ARE
THE OUTGROWTH OF MODERN LIFE:</p>

<ul class="allsmcap">
<li>DIVORCE ETIQUETTE.</li>
<li>THE FASHIONABLE FUNERAL.</li>
<li>ENDORSING SOCIAL ASPIRANTS.</li>
<li>IN CASES OF FINANCIAL FAILURE.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>It is so nice to be informed what to do when you
are divorced and how to treat your friends, if you
have any, “in cases of financial failure.” So important,
too, seeing that these social emergencies are
“the outgrowth of modern life,” and of course it’s
legitimate outgrowth—for no illegitimate outgrowth
would for a moment engage the virtuous attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
of the rival of Nellie Bly. Other chapters tell
women how to behave “when dispensing millions,”
a valuable thing for every one to know, and also the
how and whereas of “the womanly woman” in public
life—such occupations being specified as “street
cleaning, road making and regulating schools and
saloons.” Abundant illustrations are promised, and
I have no doubt the newest thing in milk shakes and
the jerking of beer will come within their scope.
The new woman grows newer every day.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> And is Judge Grant right when he says a man cannot
be healthy, virtuous or wise unless his income is
ten thousand a year?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> In <i>Harper’s</i> for October Mr. Brander Matthews
explains that story-tellers “are of three kinds.”
Startling, thrice startling, is this frightful truth which
the Second-Prize-Taker sets forth! Three kinds?
Gadzooks, and here the world has staggered along
for six thousand years believing there were only two—the
good and bad.</p>

<p>And then the breezy Brander says: “Mr. Du
Maurier has the gift of story telling. No doubt Mr.
Du Maurier has also other qualities, for instance the
gift of pleasant humor and broad sympathy.” Will
the Philistines please note that Professor Brander
Matthews of Columbia College considers that a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
may be a successful novelist and still not have “pleasant
humor” and “broad sympathy;” or should we
be charitable and take it that he is writing in self defense?</p>

<p>But a bright woman at my elbow says she knows
what Brander Matthews wrote that article for—he
wrote it for <i>Fifty Dollars</i>.</p>

<p>Then what does Brander Matthews mean when he
declares that “Miss Austen was the grandmother of
Mr. Howells”? Accidentally I once coupled Mr.
Howells with Mr. Bok, for which I duly apologized
to Mr. Howells, but I never gave him such a dig as
Brander Matthews does in the October <i>Harper’s</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The Washington <i>Capital</i> says: That baby Goliath,
<span class="smcap">The Philistine</span>, is trying hard to make something
choice in the way of a Bok bier: but what’s the use?
The Tin God is immortal.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> When in 1892 Mr. Ham Garland prophesied that
Chicago would soon be the literary center of America,
the Ink-Stained of the East said “Shoo!” But
the prophecy is fast coming true. The first edition
of Mr. Thomas W. Mudgett’s book was sold in a
week; and the good people of the Windy City are
taking a justifiable pride in the achievement of their
best known citizen. “H. H. Holmes” is Mr. Mudgett’s
<i>nom de plume</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Mr. Cudahy recommends Bovox for novel readers.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> In that bundle of choice things entitled <i>In This
Our World</i>, by Charlotte Perkins Stetson, is a poem
called “Mr. Rockefeller’s Prayer.” Preceding the
poem is this note of explanation: “The wealthy Mr.
Rockefeller is reported to have said that his income is
so much in excess of his power to spend it that he has
to kneel down every day and ask for Divine guidance
in getting rid of it.” It may here be stated for the
benefit of the unenlightened that Mr. Rockefeller
be not a Philistine, he be a Baptist, a Close Communion
Baptist, and therefore a firm believer in the
efficacy of prayer. Now while I have no wish to
quibble with Mrs. Stetson, I am of the opinion that
she has been misled as to the facts. Mr. Rockefeller
considers the Lord too much his debtor to get
down on his knees to Him, and if he ever did it was
to ask Him how to get rid of Professor Bemis and
not how to get rid of his wealth.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> And after all, has Rockefeller got rid of Bemis?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I am sorry that Anthony Hope has married off the
Princess Osra. She was a delightful old maid, and
now that she’s the Countess of Mittenheim her story’s
done. For Anthony Hope is a romanticist, not a veritist,
and therefore tells the truth about the most
vital thing in life, which is the soul of romance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
That most vital fact is that there is virtue in true
lovers and marriage is not a failure with people who
are good enough for chivalry. So there will be no
more adventures for the charming princess who has
so strong a mind and so warm a heart that she
might stand as the type of the new woman. She has
found the port and happy haven of her life. Thanks
to the breezy narrator of her voyages. But how we
shall miss the bluff monarch who has that rare
accompaniment of power—a sense of humor. Let
us petition the court chronicler of Zenda for a partial
remission of sentence. Let us have the merry
Rudolf and his boys for awhile, though the star of
his kingdom has gone out.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Sixty-nine applications for stock have reached the
Combined Press from Cluett, Coon &amp; Company’s employees

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> To gentlemen about to make presents to bookish
ladies I commend that most charming thing, <i>The
Female Offender</i>, by my esteemed co-worker in the
vineyard, C. Lombroso.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I don’t know whether the following headlines,
taken from a recent number of <i>Footlights</i>, are ironical
or sarcastic, but to a man whose memory extends
back to the thirties they seem curious: THE NEW
WOMAN—Fay Templeton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> “Every Man His Own Nordau” is the theme of
the word-builder in the <i>Scribner’s</i> foreground study
this month. “Degeneration While You Wait” is
the motto of the retrospectives who read Grant <i>et al</i>
in the Buddhist’s Own.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Possibly Mr. Pullman is <i>not</i> a praying man, and
perhaps he merely accepted “the Universalist compromise
with Infidelity,” as that staunch Calvinist,
Russell Sage, who gives $25,000 yearly to Foreign
Missions, avers; yet Mr. Pullman has not lost all
sense of piety, for he “lifts the collection” religiously
in five thousand Palace Cars every morning.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> A Richmond, Virginia, publishing house is out
with a history of the United States, and from the
advance notices it ought to have a good sale in the
land of reconstruction. All the notices are from the
land of cotton. The Houston <i>Post</i> says it sets forth
the heroic struggles “for self government and the
sovereignty of the States.” I haven’t seen any reviews
from north of Mason and Dixon’s line, but the
New York <i>Tribune</i> ought to give the book a handsome
send off, and if the <i>Tribune</i> neglects it, why
there’s the Cleveland <i>Leader</i> or La Monte G. Raymond’s
Allegany <i>Republican</i>.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> <i>McClure’s</i> pillory will present Abraham Lincoln
next. Mr. Lincoln, being dead, can not say a word.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The Sons of the House of Putnam (<i>vide</i> <i>Chip
Munk, May 15</i>), are bringing out a serial, one part
every twelve months. Quilp says that if the Sons
would make it once in twelve years it would suit him
as well.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> There is in England a flourishing sect that believes
we are now being punished for sins committed in a
former life: the chief tenet of the creed being that
this earth is Hell. The London <i>Echo</i> seriously explains
that the <span class="smcap">Philistine</span> is the organ of this peculiar
religious denomination; but the <i>Echo</i> is mistaken—the
<span class="smcap">Philistine</span> is strictly non-sectarian. It
believes there are hells which exist on earth, but
fortunately only in isolated places—and further that
the head devils in most of them are managing editors
of daily alleged newspapers.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Advance announcements of the November <i>Scribner’s</i>
emphasize the good news that “The final part
of Robert Grant’s <i>Art of Living</i> appears in this
number.” The December <i>Scribner’s</i> ought to be
pretty good.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Why Bliss Carman and Stephen Crane do not write
for <i>Lippincott’s</i> has long been a mystery to me. Some
of their verse is bad enough. But the secret is out.
They have only two names apiece.</p>
